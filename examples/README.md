## Examples

You can find here [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) containing
examples of the `gravmag` package for computing different potential-field
transformations.

- `continuation_Fourier` : up and downward continuatios of gravity disturbance data via Fourier transform.
- `continuation_eqlayer` : up and downward continuatios of gravity disturbance data via equivalent layer.
- `closed_form_eqlayer_mag` : closed-form equivalent layer associated with magnetic data.
- `gravity_disturbance` : gravity disturbance due to prisms on a realistic topography surface.
- `gravity_tensor` : gravitational tensor components and its invariants due to prisms.
- `magnetic_field` : magnetic field due to prisms.
